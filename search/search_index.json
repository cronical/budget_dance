Investments The performance report provides opening and closing balances, income, gains and something called \"Return Amount\". It does not indicate unrealized gains per se. The \"Return Amount\" is essentially a plug to get to the ending balance. Note - income needs to be marked MiscInc (not transfer to the income category) Gains are essentially realized gains. Fees for purchases and/or sales of securities are included as part of the cost basis. Other fees, that occur outside of the purchase or sale transaction are not included - such things as commissions, other account fees, and others. The other fees are rolled into the plug field (Return Amount), along with unrealized gains. It is better to include them in the Gains and therefore the 'Rlz Int/Gn' value in the spreadsheet. Thus when an account is closed, there will be no unrealized gains. To do this the investment fees need two categories. Investing:Action Fees, Investing:Account Fees. Only the account fee is selected in the Investment IandE report. This allows the loading of investment actuals to add the account fees to the gains. It also means that the transaction fees are not used to forecast future fees. This is reasonable since they are by nature not asset based and the forecast method uses percentage of assets. Other Assets The \"Other Asset\" account has several sub-accounts, including receivables from a few parties. The method of determining the transfers depends is to use the transfers-to-fcast memorized report. Some of the sub-accounts in Other Asset have transactions using expense categories. To support this the memorized report includes all expenses in the criteria. This correctly gathers the amounts such as depreciation for cars and payments made against some expense category (on our behalf). The set of a target accounts configured in this report includes all investment, loan, asset and liability accounts. Whenever there is a transfer between these accounts, this method essentially cancels out that values, which can lead to wrong balances.

Each sheet is assigned to a group and thus shares the color and table style. Sheets This section defines the layout and sometimes the data to be loaded into the sheet. It is a list of definition of each sheet. So at that level it looks like: sheets: accounts: balances: iande: ... Table Definitions Within each sheet are the list of tables. Most sheets only have one. Here's an example with two: retireparms: sheet_group: retirement tables: - name: tbl_retire_parms - name: tbl_pens_facts By convention all the table names start with tbl_ . The table definition consists of various fields, some of which are optional and/or defaulted. Item Purpose Default title The title that is place above the table in Excel columns A list of the column definitions (see below ) that are included in the table title_row When there is more than one table, locates this table on the sheet.

Moneydance uses these to categorize accounts. Its things like: Assets, Bank Accounts, Credit Cards... Accounts, Balances no_details_for For these groupings create rows only at the grouping level, no details.

Suitable when the table has a unique key. json_records Imports entire table previously exported via dance/util/extract_table.py using the -o index option. Suitable when the table does not have a unique key. tax_template Prepares the taxes worksheet Inserting Rows for Future Use The income and expense report in MoneyDance filters out categories that have no transactions. This leads to a need to insert those rows in the tbl_iande and tbl_iande_actl tables. For example, future social security payouts should subtotal into retirement income. An optional key is used to define these rows. The specification needs to contain the full hiearchy information so that it can be inserted into the right place. At run time these are checked against the existing items and added only if not already there. data: ... hier_insert_paths: - Income: \"Income:I:Retirement income:Social Security:SS-G\" - Income: \"Income:I:Retirement income:Social Security:SS-V\" Include only those lines that are not headings or totals; those will be constructed and inserted as well as the specified data lines. Actual and Forecast Formulas There are three optional keys to allow formulas to be established for the years section: actl_formulas , all_col_formulas , and fcst_formulas . They work the same way but apply to different columns, as their names indicate. Each section consists of a list of rules. All rules have the following parts: |Key word|Description| |---|---| |formula|The formula to use for the selected year columns (actual or forecast) |first_item|Optional. In some cases the first item or items of the series needs to be different. If supplied it may be a keyword skip . If it starts with = then it is a formula that will be used in the first place. Otherwise, it will be a constant or a list of constants separated by , . In that case it will be applied to the first n positions.| There are two constructions. The first is the enumeration method, where the config lists all the keys that are to be matched against a base field. Key word Description base_field The name of the column that is used for matching matches A list of values by which to match rows. This could match a single row or many rows. The second construction allows for queries against several fields. These are \"anded\" together to product a boolean series to select the rows to be updated. Key word Description query The query is a list of objects with the following fields. - field A field name in this table - compare_to A value to compare to, either a string or a number - compare_with A comparison like \"=\" For example, if there is a key fcst_formulas under the table, it is used to set formulas for the forecast columns. Each column receives the same formula, but they can vary by row. The structure is setup like this: fcst_formulas: - base_field: ValType # Near Mkt Rate matches: Mkt Gn Rate first_item: =get_val([@AcctName],\"tbl_accounts\",\"Near Mkt Rate\")*[@Active] formula: =rolling_avg() - formula: =add_wdraw( [@AcctName],this_col_name()) # Add/Wdraw for rows with distribution plans query: - field: ValType # Add/Wdraw if no distribution plan is via transfers_plan compare_with: \"=\" compare_to: \"Add/Wdraw\" - field: No Distr Plan compare_with: = compare_to: 0 ... Array formulas It is not possible to use dynamic arrays fully as they are not well supported (yet?) by openpyxl . However, some effort has been made to allow for control-shift-enter (CSE) arrays. These work best when the formula summarizes to a single cell or results in a single column of results in a fixed size array. This has been tested for use with data validation. For instance the following formula selects the active accounts with no distribution plan which is used for data validation of a table field. =SORT(FILTER(tbl_accounts[Account],(tbl_accounts[Active]=1)*(tbl_accounts[No Distr Plan]=1))) The result is stored under a heading of CHOICES. The data validation is a list with a source of =$F$3# . The # indicates the entire result set. The following formula (shown wrapped) uses dynamic array functions, but due to the openpyxl limitation it results in a CSE formula, which is fine since it produces a single value. =SUM( BYROW( (tbl_transfers_plan[[From_Account]:[To_Account]]=tbl_balances[@AcctName])*HSTACK(-tbl_transfers_plan[Amount],tbl_transfers_plan[Amount]), LAMBDA(_xlpm.row,SUM(_xlpm.row)) ) *(tbl_transfers_plan[Y_Year]=this_col_name())) The lambda function needs its parameters prefixed with _xlpm. The code handles the prefixes for the dynamic array functions. After an Excel session when the file is saved, Excel will rewrite the document so that the internal XML files have new schemas listed. Further, if a CSE formula is edited, it may be converted to a dynamic array formula, and, in that case, an internal metadata.xml file is created to support the dynamic arrays. If openpyxl later rewrites the file, the metadata.xml and the references to it in the dynamic array formulas will be lost. This has the effect of converting back to a CSE formula. Build-time created fields Some tables need a way to determine values at build time. The dyno_fields section may be directly under the table. dyno_fields: - base_field: Account matches: - 401K - GBD - TRV - CHET - Fidelity actions: - target_field: Fcst_source suffix: \"- wdraw\" - target_field: Fcst_source_tab constant: tbl_aux - base_field: ... the matches list is a list of values to be matched agains the field. There is a special case if just a single *, meaning all. The target field should be previously defined, but it is filled in by this logic. The commands available are: - suffix - something added to the matched item - constant - a value that is always the same - formula - an Excel formula Formula Specifics Always start the formula with a leading equals sign. Constants are fine, but remember to use the leading equals sign Structured table references are supported and recommended. Refer to this column with the VBA function this_col_name() Many VBA functions are designed to be used in formulas Highlights For example the following puts a line between the actual and forecast periods. The anchor, (ampersand) allows other tables to use the same by using *past_future highlights: present: &past_future formula: =A$2=get_val(\"first_forecast\",\"tbl_gen_state\",\"Value\") # ref is to heading row border: edges: - left style: thin color: B50000 Edit Checks This provides a way to use a dynamic array filter in Excel to create a data validation list (a drop down menu) for a set of columns. edit_checks: - for_columns: - From_Account - To_Account formula: =SORT(FILTER(tbl_accounts[Account],(tbl_accounts[Active]=1)*(tbl_accounts[No Distr Plan]=1))) The formula will be placed to the right of the table and the a data validation will reference it for each of the columns. In this example the active accounts with no distribution plan will be displayed as the drop down choices for the to listed columns. Specific Sheets & Tables Inflation You may want to consider a different series. The default is all items in U.S. city average, all urban consumers, not seasonally adjusted. Required minimum distributions At the time of writing the best source seems to be the Federal Register. This does not need to edited unless the source changes. Accounts The data section in the setup.yaml needs the following sub-sections: Item Description path Path from the project root where to find the saved report`. This should be one with all the accounts you wish to use. group this is a list of the summary levels you wish to use in your plan. The items can either be the categories that Moneydance uses such as Bank Accounts, or it can be summary accounts that you have created (accounts that have sub-accounts) no_details_for If you have summary accounts that cover all the items in a category, then you can use those instead of the leaf accounts. By listing the category hear the detail accounts will be ignored. include_zeros Usually zero balance accounts will be ignored. If the account is entered here, it will be carried forward. This can be useful if its a brand new account with no balance or if its an old account that had a balance in the historical period. tax_free_keys A list of keywords that will be used to determine how the tax status of the account will be initialized. Example: path: ./data/2022 Account Balances.tsv group: - Bank Accounts - Credit Cards - Real Estate - Other Asset - Liabilities - Mortgage Loans - Non Mort Loans no_details_for: - Assets - Loans include_zeros: - My old HSA - My old 401K tax_free_keys: - 401K - \"529\" - IRA","title":"Setting up the spreadsheet"},{"location":"setup/#setting-up-the-spreadsheet","text":"","title":"Setting up the spreadsheet"},{"location":"setup/#summary-of-steps","text":"Prepare data files.

Key word Description base_field The name of the column that is used for matching matches A list of values by which to match rows. This could match a single row or many rows. The second construction allows for queries against several fields. These are \"anded\" together to product a boolean series to select the rows to be updated.

However, some effort has been made to allow for control-shift-enter (CSE) arrays. These work best when the formula summarizes to a single cell or results in a single column of results in a fixed size array. This has been tested for use with data validation. For instance the following formula selects the active accounts with no distribution plan which is used for data validation of a table field. =SORT(FILTER(tbl_accounts[Account],(tbl_accounts[Active]=1)*(tbl_accounts[No Distr Plan]=1))) The result is stored under a heading of CHOICES. The data validation is a list with a source of =$F$3# . The # indicates the entire result set. The following formula (shown wrapped) uses dynamic array functions, but due to the openpyxl limitation it results in a CSE formula, which is fine since it produces a single value. =SUM( BYROW( (tbl_transfers_plan[[From_Account]:[To_Account]]=tbl_balances[@AcctName])*HSTACK(-tbl_transfers_plan[Amount],tbl_transfers_plan[Amount]), LAMBDA(_xlpm.row,SUM(_xlpm.row)) ) *(tbl_transfers_plan[Y_Year]=this_col_name())) The lambda function needs its parameters prefixed with _xlpm. The code handles the prefixes for the dynamic array functions. After an Excel session when the file is saved, Excel will rewrite the document so that the internal XML files have new schemas listed. Further, if a CSE formula is edited, it may be converted to a dynamic array formula, and, in that case, an internal metadata.xml file is created to support the dynamic arrays.

Due to trouble with the listobject function which makes values empty for cells with formulas, a work around is used. To determine the table name from the worksheet name.this should be ok for major tables which correspond by convention. log Sub log(txt As String) LUMP Function LUMP(account As String, y_year As String) As Double Return the expected lump sum payment for an account based on the prior year's end balance MedicarePrem Function MedicarePrem(b_or_d As Integer, year As String, inflation As Variant, Optional magi As Variant = -1) As Variant Given a year (as y+year), return annual part b premium or part d surcharge (irmaa). Normally look up the modifed adjusted gross from 2 years ago, but if its supplied, like for a test, use that instead.. B_or_d isa 1 for part b premium or 2 for part d surcharge. If the year is not in the table, then the largest year lower than that given will be used. And the resulting value will include inflation. inflation is given as 1.0x so it can be used directly mo_apply Function mo_apply(start_date As Date, y_year As String, Optional end_mdy As String = \"\") As Double Get a rational number that represents the number of months that apply in a particular year given the start date and optionally an end date. The end date is a string since there is a bug in the mac excel..

If the year is not in the table, then the largest year lower than that given will be used. And the resulting value will include inflation. inflation is given as 1.0x so it can be used directly PartDSurcharge Function PartDSurcharge(year As String, inflation As Variant, Optional magi As Variant = -1) As Variant Given a year (as y+year) and the modifed adjusted gross (2 years ago) return annual part d surcharge. If the year is not in the table, then the largest year lower than that given will be used.

It is also possible that we may want to re-organize or rename the rows. Take deleted rows first.
