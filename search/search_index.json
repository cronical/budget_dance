This correctly gathers the amounts such as depreciation for cars and payments made against some expense category (on our behalf).  The set of a target accounts configured in this report includes all investment, loan, asset and liability accounts.

All rules have the following parts:</p> Key word Description formula The formula to use for the selected year columns (actual or forecast) first_item Optional. In some cases the first item or items of the series needs to be different. If supplied it may be a keyword <code>skip</code>. If it starts with <code>=</code> then it is a formula that will be used in the first place. Otherwise, it will be a constant or a list of constants separated by <code>,</code>. In that case it will be applied to the first n positions. <p>There are two constructions.  The first is the enumeration method, where the config lists all the keys that are to be matched against a base field.</p> Key word Description base_field The name of the column that is used for matching matches A list of values by which to match rows. This could match a single row or many rows. <p>The second construction allows for queries against several fields.  These are \"anded\" together to product a boolean series to select the rows to be updated.</p> Key word Description query The query is a list of objects with the following fields. - field A field name in this table - compare_to A value to compare to, either a string or a number - compare_with A comparison like \"=\", starts, not_starting, is_in.

However, some effort has been made to allow for control-shift-enter (CSE) arrays. These work best when the formula summarizes to a single cell or results in a single column of results in a fixed size array.

Further, if a CSE formula is edited, it may be converted to a dynamic array formula, and, in that case, an internal <code>metadata.xml</code> file is created to support the dynamic arrays.  If <code>openpyxl</code> later rewrites the file, the <code>metadata.xml</code> and the references to it in the dynamic array formulas will be lost.
