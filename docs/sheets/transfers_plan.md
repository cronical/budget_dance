# transfers_plan

This table simulates future transactions which move money between accounts.  So it has a transaction year, a source (from) account and a target (to) account, and an amount.

There is data validation on the account names to ensure they do not have a distribution plan.

These data are summarized and carried on the the balances tab in future years on the Add/Wdraw lines.
