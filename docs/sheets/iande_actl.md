This is Income and Expense actuals as it comes from Moneydance `Income & Expense by Year` report.  A key is constructed which includes the hierarchy.  That occurs in the A column. The summary rows are replaced by formulas as part of the import process.  These can be copied into future years. The column headings are of the Y+year style to facilitate lookups.  

This data is loaded from `data/iande.tsv` with the program  `iande-actl-load.py`
