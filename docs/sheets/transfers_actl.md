# transfers-actl

This table shows the transfers to and from all accounts coming from or going to banks or credit cards.  

It also shows the transfers to and from all bank and all credit card accounts at a summary level.  The bank and credit card transfers are based on the difference of successive balances.

## Accounting Assumption

If there are transfers between these accounts, then they should pass through a bank account in order to be captured here.  That is the purpose of the pseudo bank account 'Passthru' and its sub-accounts in Moneydance.

## Folding

Other than Banks and Credit cards, the hierarchy of accounts is used allowing summarized values to be computed.

## Data Sources

This tab is loaded by `transfers-actl-load.py` from these sources:

1. A copy of the output of moneydance transfer report stored under `data/transfers.tsv.  
2. The method used is the difference of progressive balances.  The balances are generated by the `Account Balances` report selecting only banks and credit cards.  This is done for each year.  The tab-separated files are stored under `budget/data` as `bank-bal-YYYY`.
