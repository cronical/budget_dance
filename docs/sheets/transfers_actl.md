## transfers-actl

Gathers the transfers to and from all accounts coming from or going to banks or credit cards.  This also shows the transfers to and from bank and credit card accounts.  The bank and credit card transfers are derived another way and are also included on this tab.

If there are transfers between these accounts, then they should pass through a bank account in order to be captured here.  That is the purpose of the pseudo bank account 'Passthru' and its sub-accounts in Moneydance.

This tab is loaded by `transfers-actl-load.py` from these sources:

1. A copy of the output of moneydance transfer report stored under `budget/data`.  
2. The method used is the difference of progressive balances.  The balances are generated by the `Account Balances` report selecting only banks and credit cards.  This is done for each year.  The tab-separated files are stored under `budget/data` as `bank-bal-YYYY`. 
3. A third method is planned which will ensure that all accounts have rows - even those with zero transfers.
