# Tools to map accounting data to long term plans

The accounting system is Moneydance.  The long term planning is via Excel.

This spreadsheet extends the family's historical financials into the future.  It allows for modeling and planning for 

- Income and expenses (combined with cash flow)
- Accounts balances and transfers (including investments)
- Working life and retirement phases
- Federal and state income taxes. The tax calculator is far from general.

The spreadsheet is built by Python programs.  Actual data is based on data exported from Moneydance.
