# Tool links accounting data with long term plans

This system extends the family's historical financials into the future.  It allows for modeling and planning for 

- Income and expenses (combined with cash flow)
- Accounts balances and transfers (including investments)
- Working life and retirement phases
- Post retirement medical plans (U.S.)
- U.S. Federal and state income taxes. The tax calculator is far from general.

The accounting system is Moneydance.  The long term planning is via Microsoft 365 Excel.

## Data

- The data for historical (actual) periods is based on data exported from Moneydance.
- Data for planning is controlled via a set of external files.

The workbook is built from the above by Python programs controlled by an extensive configuration file.
